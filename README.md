## About
Crop cultivation demands accurate, precise and consistent inspection in the field and elsewhere. For virtually all crops inspection is a manual process of visual inspection performed by trained experts. Yet, the challenge with crop inspection or any visual inspection regime for that matter, is the time and effort associated with the inspection, finding qualified inspectors to perform that inspection with the necessary frequency and, most important, obtaining consistent, precise and accurate data from multiple inspectors. Bloomfield applies AI and deep learning to complement the work of the crop inspectors by identifying and assessing the same plant characteristics and anomalies that human visual inspection looks for and assesses now.
